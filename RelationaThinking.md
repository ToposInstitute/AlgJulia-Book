#  What is this book about? (priyaa Version)

Priyaa Varshinee Srinivasan (for my own reference)

The central theme of this book is **RELATIONAL THINKING**. What does relational thinking mean? Contemplating on these words reveals that it is a thinking process which emphasizes on relationships between individual entities. It is a shift in perspective of the world around us as a collection of stand-alone entitites to the world as an expression of interconnections that exists between the individual entitites. 

## 1.1. Relational thinking

Humans have been thinking for ages and we have made marvelous progress in the last thousand years unlike any other species. Its an indication of a working thinking process. So, why should one care for new perspectives on thinking -- something that humans have been doing since time unknown and something that has worked so well so far? The answer lies in the very question -- mainly it has worked so well that it has surpassed its own abilities.  Science and technology has interconnected our world in unprecedented ways -- interconnections in terms of efficient transport systems, interconnections in terms of information technologies and so on. 

Interconnections and complexity are two sides of the same coin: with the exploding growth of interconnections, the processes in the world are becoming increasing complex.  Simlpistic forms of thinking in making sense of the world no longer provide a holistic understanding of the world around us. For example, let us consider a "boquet". A cave man would probably make a boquet by walking to the forest and returning with a bunch of flowers. As civilization arose, boquets probably were made from flowers grown in local gardens -- there are more interconnections to account for but they are still manageable by creating simple information systems.  In the current age, when I walk to Trader's Joe and pick up a flower boquet, each type of flower was probably cultivated in different places, thousands of miles away. I do not have much understanding about the process of a boquet except for the information provided in the label. The interconnections that enable a simple flower boquet to be available for purchase at a supermarket are mind-boggling in the current scenario. One may argue such information and knowledge is irrelevant. However, it is acceptable that the current major challenges face by the humanity including global warming and ideological wars arise by impartial view and a non-holistic understanding of the world. 

Considering all the necessary interconnections to gain a holistic understanding is however hard without a proper accounting system. The lack of a holistic understanding or willingness to forego a holistic view may be attributed to the lack of such accounting systems and thinking processes that reflects such accounting systems. Hence, in the current world, it is all the more important to rethink our thinking processes to shift its focus on interconnections for better visibility and progress. However, thinking about thinking is hard, unless we have a reliable guide to guide our thinking (about thinking). The name of our guide in this book is **Category theory**. 

(Brendan has wrote a real-nice introduction on mathematical thinking and category theory for the same.)

Relational thinking and systems thinking are the same in their core philosophy. Wikipedia says,

:::{note}
**Systems thinking** is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts. 
:::

We could say that relational thinking is systems thinking guided by formal mathematics (Category Theory). For example, systems thinking heavily uses diagrams (causal loop diagrams, systems archetypes, behaviour over time diagrams) to sketch the thinking process, to ask right questions, and for communication. In relational thinking, the diagrams rather than being free-hand, will be formal mathematical objects, like numbers, that have specific meaning and can be manipulated. As we will see in the Part 2, such guided arrangement of relationships supports questions like "What is the *good* way to change the structure of this system with respect to the interconnections of the system?" The good ways are called as "universal properties" in Category Theory.

## 1.2. Abstracting Relational thinking

(The content of this section is adapted from Brendan's book message)

### The whole is composed of parts

This is the fundamental principle of systems thinking: to

### Composition structure vs meaning of composition
...
### Systems thinking is hierarchical 
...
### Systems thinking can be manipulated independent of context 
...
### Sense of _goodness_
...

## 1.3. Computing Relational thinking
