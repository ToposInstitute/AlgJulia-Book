# Chapter 1. What is this book about?

Priyaa Varshinee Srinivasan (for my own reference)

The central theme of this **RELATIONAL THINKING**. What does relational thinking mean? Contemplating on these words for a few seconds reveals a possible meaning that it is a thinking process which emphasizes on relationships between individual entities. It is a shift in perspective of the world around us as a collection of stand-alone entitites to world as an expression of interconnections that exists between the individual entitites. 

## 1.1. Relational thinking

Humans have been thinking for ages and we have made marvelous progress unlike any other species on Earth in terms of quality of life. Its an indication of a working thinking process. So, why would one care for new perspectives on something we already have been doing since time unknown, especially when it has worked so well so far? The answer lies in the very question -- because it has worked so well.  Science and technology has interconnected world in unprecedented ways -- interconnections in terms of transport systems, interconnections in terms of digitual technologies and so on. 

Along side interconnections, the complexity of the world has also been growing steadily. The complexity of the processes has begun to surpass the ability of traditional forms of thinking in making sense of the world. For example, let us consider a "boquet". A cave man would probably would make a boquet by walking to the forest and returning with a bunch of flowers. As civilization, boquets probably are made from flowers grown in local gardens.  In the current age, when I walk to Trader's Joe and pick up a flower boquet, I have not no clue about who, how, where, when the flowers were grown except for the information in the label. The interconnections that enable a flower boquet to be available for purchase at a supermarket are mind-boggling. One may argue such information is irrelevant. However, it is an undenibale fact that the major challenges the humanity faces today including global warming and ideological wars arose by deeming necessary information as irrelevant. 

Alternatively, it can be said that the lack of refined thinking processes that allows viewing and accounting for complex interconnections has paved way to ignoring necessary information, allowing decisions to be based on an partial view of the world. Hence, in the current world, it is all the more important to rethink our thinking processes for better visibility and progress. However, thinking about thinking is hard, unless we have a reliable guide to guide our thinking (about thinking). The name of our guide in this book is **Category theory**. 

Relational thinking and systems thinking are the same in their core philosophy. Wikipedia says,

**Systems thinking** is a way of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its parts.

We could say that relational thinking is systems thinking guided by formal mathematics (Category Theory). For example, systems thinking heavily uses diagrams (causal loop diagrams, systems archetypes, behaviour over time diagrams) to sketch the thinking process, to ask right questions, and for communication. In relational thinking, the diagrams rather than being free-hand, will be formal mathematical objects, like numbers, that have specific meaning and can be manipulated. As we will see in the Part 2, such guided arrangement of relationships supports questions like "What is the *good* way to change the strcutre of this system with respect to the interconnections of the system?" The good ways are called as "universal properties" in Category Theory.

## 1.2. Abstracting Relational thinking

(Adapted from Brendan's book message)

### The whole is composed of parts
...

### Composition structure vs meaning of composition
...
### Systems thinking is hierarchical 
...
### Systems thinking can be manipulated independent of context 
...
### Sense of _goodness_
...

## 1.3. Computing Relational thinking
