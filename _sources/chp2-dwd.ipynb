    "Bourba is feeling super grouchy today but luckily being around Kiki tends to improve Bourba's mood. Kiki, on the other hand, is feeling great! Unfortunately, when Bourba is down in the dumps, it really drags down Kiki's mood too. But when Kiki's in a bad mood it only makes Bourba feel *worse*.\n",
    "\n",
    "How will these friends' moods *interact*? Will Kiki manage to cheer Bourba up or will they both end up depressed? Or maybe their moods will alternate back and forth in and endless cycle of cheering up and bumming out:\n",

    "The mood change is dependent on three **parameters** namely susceptibility factor, tolerance levels and calm down rates.  Parameter values of a process block remain constant (does not change over time). They can be thought of as weights for the variables (inputs and current state) in the computation of dynamics. \n",

    "Here is a possible dynamics of mood change in words based on the above assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> At each instant of time, each friend takes in a certain amount of other person’s mood based on their susceptibility. They also release certain amount of their mood based on the calm down rate. If they reach their excitement or grumpiness maximum tolerance levels, then they just calm down; no more interaction!\n",

    "Dynamical systems and directed graphs are a useful framework for modeling the world. Indeed, they are a close match for how humans tend to conceptualize things. We instinctively look at the world in terms of cause and effect, in terms of procedures which play out over time, in terms of things-acting-upon-other-things. \n",
    "\n",
    "But this is just one way of looking at the world. And not all systems are best understood in these terms. In the coming sections we will develop to a more *relational* approach, a subtle and versatile way of working with graphs having an emphasis on constraints and filters instead of step-by-step procedures. Systems that maintain a kind of equilibrium or balancing act between simultaneous constraints."
