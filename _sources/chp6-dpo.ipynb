    "\"Find-and-replace\" feature of text editors is one of the most powerful innovations of the 20th century. Inspite of unavailability of statistics, the advantage of this feature is tangible and undeniable! Beyond text editors, the concept of \"find and replace\" has also caused much chaos in the world! When the European conquerors \"found\" native Americans settlements in Canada, they decided to \"replace\" the native culture by sending an entire generation of native American children to special missionary schools. This has resulted in trauma and chaos that continues well into the current times. Or a country waging war over another country to replace the exisiting government for political reasons! Or Large-scale replacement of forests by industries and settlements has adversely impacting global climate.\n",

    "While being healthy makes a person happy, eating sugar makes a person happy in a different way. Hence, removing sugar results in a broken connection and an unstable structure! The result is usually to restore stability by brining (more) sugar back! Even though this example is oversimplistic, it drives home the message connections playing an important role in driving our lives and why careful considerations of connections is necessary to make a positive change. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to make a change, it is recommended to start with something simple. The simple thing we shall do in this chapter is to build a way to make changes to an existing graph in a \"good\" way. By good, we mean that we do not end up with broken connections, and make precisely the changes that are intended. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making changes to a graph means adding new vertices/edges or removing existing vertices/edges or both. And these changes happen over particular region(s) of the graph (like a textual find and replace).\n",

A add-first and remove-next procedure must handle accidental errors like which are otherwise absent in the other order: \n",
