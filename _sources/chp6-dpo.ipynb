    "\"Find-and-replace\" feature of text editors is one of the most powerful innovations of the 20th century. Inspite of unavailability of statistics, the advantage of this feature is tangible and undeniable! Beyond text editors, the concept of \"find and replace\" has also caused much chaos in the world than being helpful! When the European conquerors \"found\" native Americans settlements in Canada, they decided to \"replace\" the native culture by sending an entire generation of native American children to special missionary schools. This has resulted in trauma and chaos that continues well into the current times. Or a country trying to replace the ruling government of another country for political reasons. (may be an ecology example).  \n",
