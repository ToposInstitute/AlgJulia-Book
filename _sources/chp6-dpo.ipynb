    "\"Find-and-replace\" feature of text editors is one of the most powerful innovations of the 20th century. Inspite of unavailability of statistics, the advantage of this feature is tangible and undeniable! Beyond text editors, the concept of \"find and replace\" has also caused much chaos in the world than being helpful! When the European conquerors \"found\" native Americans settlements in Canada, they decided to \"replace\" the native culture by sending an entire generation of native American children to special missionary schools. This has resulted in trauma and chaos that continues well into the current times. Or a country trying to replace the ruling government of another country for political reasons. (may be an ecology example).  \n",

    "To begin with, let us think what would be filled in the \"Find what:\" and \"Replace with:\" boxes. \n",
    "\n",
    "```Find what``` box must take in a graph. This is the graph that will be \"found\" in a host graph. ```Replace with```: box should also take in a graph. This is the graph that will replace the graph provided in ```Find what```. \n",
    "\n",
    "Great, we are half-way through! We are only half-way through beacuse, we also need to specify the relationship between ```Find what``` and ```Replace with```! This is because the ```Replace with``` graph may retain some or all of the vertices/edges of ```Find what``` graph. The replacement procedure must leave those vertices and edges intact in a host graph, and orient the replacement graph accordingly. There is only one way of replacing a text by another. But there are multiple ways to replace one graph by another depending how the replacement graph unless specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, the single vertex in the ```Find what``` can be replaced any of the two vertices in the \"```Replace with```\" graph, or none (the vertex and the self loop is erased and a new graph is put in its place)!\n",

    "Hence, the specification for \"find and replace\" needs to include information on what vertices and edges are the same between the ```Find what``` and the ```Replace with``` graphs. The best way to do this would be to use an injective morphism from ```Find what``` to ```Replace with```. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, there would be an injective morphism from ```Find-what``` into ``````Replace with`````` if the self-loop of the ```Find-what``` had remained in the ```Replace-with``` (as shown below). The graph on the right can be viewed as the ```Find-what``` plus a new vertex and an edge.

    "Thus, an appropriate match will leave all the edges connected after the replacement and will identify vertices / edges to be deleted seperate from the good vertices / edges in the host graph. In a nutshell, it will satsify the \"no-dangling-edge\" and the \"right identification\" conditions.\n",

    "In programming, there is a concept called \"edge case\". These are special situations where a code will fail to produce appropriate results. For example, a bug that occurs in only iPhone. They are called \"edge cases\" because these situations lie outside the normal flow of a code / algorithm and custom extra code is added for their special handling. There is an anecdote, \"Edge cases are impossible to avoid, so keep them simple\". \n",

    "The good news is that the *universal nature* of pushouts guarantee us that pushout-complement will exist ONLY for appropraite matches!! That is, replacement will be done only when the match is appropriate. Hence, there are no edge cases!!! We did all the heavy lifting early-on by relying on relational thinking, considering all the relevant relationships, and getting the *plumbing* right! The pay off is that things flow smoothly without the need for extra intervention! \n",
