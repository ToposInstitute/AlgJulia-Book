    "\n",
    "So far, we have seen that graphs are a quite simple and powerful tool to model relationships between various entities. We also learnt the idea of identifying one graph inside another via a graph morphism. A graph morphism may coarse-grain the information in the domain graph by sending two different vertices/edge of the domain to the same vertex/edge in the codomain but it always **preserves the connectivity** of the domain. Finally, excitingly, with graph morphisms, we enter the \"universe\" where we can find every possible \"graph-world\" and every possible relationships between these worlds. In this chapter, we \"live\" inside this universe where the only entities are graphs and morphisms between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside this universe, we are interested to know how to combine two graphs, like adding two numbers (if this analogy sounds odd to you, towards the end of this chapter we will see that adding numbers is same as combining two discrete graphs). The utilitiy of combining graphs is to bridge islands of connections allowing for information to flow between the graphs (via common channels) and for expression of new meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a step towards making sense of the idea of combining graphs, let us a revisit a graph that we met in the first chapter — “Whose turn is it to do dishes?”.\n",

    "In this graph, Paul claimed to be friends with Tuco (to our unaware readers, Tuco is Paul’s neighbor’s cat). Paul is also a friend of Brendan, Angeline and Priyaa (co-authors of this book). Encoding these friendships as graphs, we get:\n",

    "\n",
    "We see new information emerging in the combined graph. Tuco “is a friend of a friend” for Brendan, Priyaa, and Angeline. If we assume that a friend of a friend is a friend, then one can infer that Tuco “is a friend of” Brendan, Angeline and Priyaa. The connections in the combined graph supports such assumptions and inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example is deceivingly simple. By eyeballing the two friendship graphs, it is easy to see by common experience how the graphs can be combined. But, graphs generated in the real world are quite complex. \n",

    "In practice, combining such graphs using pen and paper is out question! However, it is the same common sense that is in play combining even the most complex graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this chapter is to make our inherent sense of combining graphs more explicit and fun! Once explicit, we all can agree unambiguously what does it mean to combine two graphs together. We will achieve this goal by playing a game of dumb charades of graphs using memes from relational thinking (popularly known as category theory)! \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of this game is to communicate “the connectivity of any combined graph” without explicitly saying what the graph is! This is because, while in the universe we can talk (only) about relationships between graphs. Once we look inside a graph, we will no longer be in the universe but we would be inside a graph-world which is unaware of any other (graph) worlds. A *combined* graph needs to be aware of the graphs which it combined (otherwise it just any old graph). So, we need to stay in the level of universe to talk about combining graphs!\n",

    "## 5.2 Combining graphs using memes\n",
    "\n",
    "The two memes we will use to play this game are: (1) commuting diagrams, and (2) graph isomorphisms. Having explored the idea of commuting diagrams and sameness in the previous chapter, we are now ready to play! \n",

    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "A `pushout` (of two overlapping graphs) is a graph in the space of all possible graphs. We need to spot that graph in this space! We will narrow down our search step-by-step using the memes we have learnt. We will continue this process until we end up with the graph we are looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will draw lots and lots of diagrams for this narrowing down process! Diagrams are basic to relational thinking!\n",

    "Let us begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The shape of the overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine two graphs, we first need to know which vertices and edges are common to both the graphs. Recollect that the “Paul” vertex was common to both the friendship graphs we met early in the chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in previous chapters that a graph morphism identifies one graph inside another. Suppose we are given two graphs -- `graph A` and `graph B`. An overlap of these two graphs is specified as the diagram below: a diagram with two radiating arrows, one into `graph A` and another one into `graph B`. Graph `overlap` specifies the vertices and edges common to `graph A` and `graph B`! Note that a relational specification of common vertices and edges as shown below ensures that the overlapping region will be a graph by itself (no dangling edges)!\n",

    "\n",
    "- `overlap` maps into `graph A`.\n",
    "- `overlap` maps into `graph B`.\n",
    "- Thus, the regions in which `overlap` maps into `graph A` and `graph B` are common to the two graphs.\n",
    " \n",
    "(The morphisms in the above diagram are injective, but in general they need not be so! Connecitivity matters!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `overlap` acts as a bridge between two graphs. Theoretically, presence of an overlap means that we can navigate from one graph to the other via common vertices and edges. That is, we can combine `graph A` and `graph B` into a single graph. This idea of a combining graphs can be loosely illustrated as sticking together two sheets of paper using glue.\n",

However, once set up right, the tools make life better because all the complex thinking is handled early on eliminating the necessity to think cleverly about the edge cases when the tools is used.  We will demonstrate this idea in the next chapter when we look into the concept of “find and replace” inside graphs! You would be accustomed to using the “find-and-replace” operation in text editors.
