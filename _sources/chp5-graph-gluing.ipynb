    "So far, we have seen that graphs are a quite simple and powerful tool to model relationships between various entities. We also learnt the idea of identifying one graph inside another via a graph morphism. A graph morphism may coarse-grain the information in the domain graph by sending two different vertices/edge of the domain to the same vertex/edge in the codomain but it always **preserves the connectivity** of the domain. Finally, excitingly, with graph morphisms, we enter the \"universe\" where we can find every possible \"graph-world\" and the every possible relationships between these worlds. In this chapter, we \"live\" inside this universe where the only entities are graphs and morphisms between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside this universe, we are interested in the mechanism of combining two graphs, like adding two numbers (if this analogy sounds odd to you, towards the end of this chapter we will see that adding numbers is same as combining two discrete graphs). The utilitiy of combining graphs is to bridge islands of connections allowing for information to flow between the graphs (via common channels) and for expression of new meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a step towards making sense of the idea of combining graphs, let us a revisit a graph that we met in the first chapter — “Whose turn is it to do dishes?”.\n",

If we assume that a friend of a friend is a friend, then one can infer that Tuco “is a friend of” Brendan, Angeline and Priyaa. The connections in the combined graph supports such assumptions and inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example is deceivingly simple. By eyeballing the two friendship graphs, it is easy to see by common experience how the graphs can be combined. But, graphs generated in the real world are quite complex. In practice, combining such graphs using pen and paper is out question! However, it is the same common sense in play combining even the most complex graphs [^1].\n",

    "The goal of this chapter is to make our inherent sense of combining graphs more explicit and fun! Once explicit, we all can agree unambiguously what does it mean to combine two graphs together. We will achieve this goal by playing a game of dumb charades of graphs using memes from relational thinking. Relational thinking is popularly known as category theory in the mathematics community! \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of this game is to communicate “the connectivity of any combined graph” without explicitly saying what the graph is! This is because, while in the universe we can talk about relationships between graphs. Once we look inside a graph, we will no longer be in the universe but we would be inside a graph-world which is unaware of any other (graph) worlds. A *combined* graph needs to be aware of graphs which it combined (otherwise it just any old graph). So, we need to stay in the level of universe to talk about combining graphs!\n",

    "Having explored the idea of commuting diagrams and sameness in the previous chapter, we are now ready to play our game of dumb charades of graphs! The goal of the game is to describe what a combined graph of any two (overlapping) graphs is without saying what the vertices, edges, source and target maps of the combined graph are! Given two overlapping graphs, let us call their combined graph as the “pushout” of the two graphs along the overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pushout is a graph in the space of all possible graphs. We need to spot what graph it is! We will narrow down our search step-by-step by expressing requirements of a pushout using the memes we have learnt. We will continue this process until we end up with the graph we are looking for. \n",

    "### 5.1.1. Shape of the overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine two graphs, we first need to know which vertices and edges are common to both the graphs. Recollect that the “Paul” vertex was common to both the friendship graphs we met early in the chapter. Let’s call the common vertices and edges as the ***overlap*** of the two graphs. So, to combine two graphs, we need to know their overlap. \n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in previous chapters that a graph morphism identifies one graph inside another.  Let us suppose we have three graphs, and two morphisms as shown in the diagram below. Let us not worry what exactly Graph-1, Graph-2, Graph-3! Remember, we live in universe and do not peek inside graphs! The rectangles are placeholders which can receive any graph in them.\n",

    "- Thus, the regions in which Graph-1 embeds, Graph-2 and Graph-3 overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “overlap” acts as a bridge between two graphs. Theoretically, presence of an overlap means that we can navigate from one graph to the other via common vertices and edges. That is, we can combine Graph-2 and Graph-3 into a single graph. This idea of a combining graphs can be loosely illustrated as sticking together two sheets of paper using glue.\n",

This relationship is also a pair of maps: a vertex map between vertices of the graphs and an arrow map between the edges of the graphs. What makes a graph embedding purposeful is its harmonious behavior with the existing source and the target maps in the domain and the codomain. This harmony is precisely encoded as a pair of commuting diagrams.\n",

    "Hey, did you notice that commuting diagrams look like directed graphs?! But they are very specific sort of graphs - they have an *origin* vertex which has only outgoing arrows (Edges of Graph-1), and a *destination* vertex which has only incoming arrows (Vertices of Graph-2). Hence, these graphs are non-cyclic. One follows any arrow from the origin to reach the destination. There are multiple choices of paths to take from the origin (two paths in each of the above diagrams). The word commuting refers to the fact that, for an edge in “Edges of Graph-1”, following any of the path, will lead to the same vertex in “Vertices of Graph-2”. In a commuting diagram, all the paths are practically the same. Commuting diagrams signify diversity of paths but unity of purpose.\n",

    "The idea of “sameness” or “sama” is that in certain context, two distinguishable objects are considered to be equal or identical — their meaning is considered to be the same. Under the context of color, all the outfits of Steve Jobs were identical / equal (can't be told apart). Under the context of recipe, the breakfast Brendan eats are identical / equal (can't be told apart). \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to blur the lines between the meaning of objects and group them into one, by placing them in a certain context is quite natural to human thinking and is also useful. Imagine a world without weighing scales which is a practical demonstration of “sameness” (under the context of weight)! The concept of “sameness” is an instance of relational thinking in everyday life. \n",
    "\n",
    "When someone speaks of sameness of two things, there exists an (unspoken) context hidden in it. The idea of sameness is manifestation of this unspoken context. Relational thinking (in mathematical sense) supports making this context explicit thereby eliminating the room for arguments if two things are same or not. (Eugenia Cheng has explained this very beautifully. I think a reference to her explanation or a video embedding will be very helpful.)\n",

    "In this section, we want to explore the “sameness of graphs” through the lens of relational thinking. The question of finding out if two graphs are the same is an area of study by itself and beyond the scope of this book. We are more interesting in making explicit the relationship that makes two graphs the same.\n",

    "Before I end this section, I would like to entertain you with a personal story tangentially related to graphs and the idea of sameness! When we were young, my brother and I were very fond of “Maggi noodles”.  My mom considered Maggi noodles to be both unhealthy and expensive. But, because we were fond of it, she would occasionally bring home two packets of these noodles. It was brother’s task to cook these noodles. After cooking, he would spilt the noodles into two portions and I would be given a chance to pick one I wanted. I always had great trouble in making up my mind, since whichever portion I picked, mine looked lesser to me. Often, I would ask to change since my brother’s portion looked bigger. My mom with great annoyance would reply, “Both the portions are the same! It's your eyes which are big!”. \n",
