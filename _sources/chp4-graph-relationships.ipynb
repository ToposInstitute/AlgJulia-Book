    "In Chapter 1 we saw an example of a directed graph which described the layout of a ski resort. In this account, you could ride the ski lift up and down the mountain or ski from the top of the mountain into a nearby village.\n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose we visit this ski resort in the Summer when there's no snow. At this time of year the resort lets guests ride up and down the mountain in the lift (which provides a *lovely* view!), but there is no way to get down the mountain into the village without a snow pack to ski on.\n",

    "One way to think about the relationship between these two graphs is that we can turn one into the other. Given the Summer map I can _turn it into_ the winter map by adding the additional vertices and arrows associated with travelling to the village. On the other hand, given the Winter map, I can create the Summer map by _deleting_ the arrows and vertices associated with the village.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we might call a \"procedural\" way of thinking about the Summer and Winter maps; you imagine step-by-step procedures that could be applied to transform one map into the other. In order to make our way towards \"relational\" thinking we are going to recommend different way of looking at these two graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the Summer graph is basically contained inside of the Winter graph. For the Summer graph to be a \"part\" of the Winter graph means, in effect, that we can map the Summer graph *into* the Winter graph, taking vertices to vertices and arrows to arrows.\n",

Thus, there is another directed graph which also accurately describes the chore progression, but now in terms of the handedness of dish-washer.\n",

    "The second model is a \"coarse grained\" version of the first. It is consistent with the first model but contains fewer details (*ie* it does not tell us which right handed person is doing the dishes at any given moment). This coarse-graining can be captured by the following way of mapping the first graph into the second:\n",
