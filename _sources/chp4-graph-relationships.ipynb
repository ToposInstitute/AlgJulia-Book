    "In Chapter 1 we saw an example of a directed graph which described the layout of a ski resort. In this account, you could ride the ski lift up and down the mountain or ski from the top of the mountain into a nearby village.\n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose we visit this ski resort in the Summer when there's no snow. At this time of year the resort lets guests ride up and down the mountain in the lift (which provides a *lovely* view!), but there is no way to get down the mountain into the village without a snow pack to ski on.\n",

    "One way to think about the relationship between these two graphs is that we can turn one into the other. Given the Summer map I can _turn it into_ the winter map by adding the additional vertices and arrows associated with travelling to the village. On the other hand, given the Winter map, I can create the Summer map by _deleting_ the arrows and vertices associated with the village.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a procedural way of looking at the Summer and Winter maps, a procedure that could be applied to transform one into the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our ongoing quest to think about things in terms of their relationships instead of in terms of the things themselves, we are going to recommedn another way of looking at these two graphs. Note how the Summer graph is basically contained inside of the Winter graph. How should we characterize this relationship? For the Summer graph to be a \"part\" of the Winter graph means, in effect, that we can map the Summer graph *into* the Winter graph, taking vertices to vertices and arrows to arrows.\n",
