    "One way to think about the relationship between these two graphs is that we can turn one into the other. Given the Summer map I can _turn it into_ the winter map by adding the additional vertices and arrows associated with travelling to the village. On the other hand, given the Winter map, I can create the Summer map by _deleting_ the arrows and vertices associated with the village.\n",

    "This is what we might call a \"procedural\" way of thinking about the Summer and Winter maps; you imagine step-by-step procedures that could be applied to transform one map into the other.

Thus, there is another directed graph which also accurately describes the chore progression, but now in terms of the handedness of dish-washer.\n",

    "The second model is a \"coarse grained\" version of the first. It is consistent with the first model but contains fewer details (*ie* it does not tell us which right handed person is doing the dishes at any given moment). This coarse-graining can be captured by the following way of mapping the first graph into the second:\n",

    "In this chapter we have developed the crucial idea of **graph morphisms**. We have understood this concept from two points of view, the geometric human view and the more formal computational vantage of AlgebraicJulia. The exact correspondance between these views means that if we _only_ think about graphs in terms of graph morphisms then everything we think can be encoded in AlgebraicJulia. In the next two chapters we will discover patterns of morphisms that correspond to useful operations like adding, deleting, merging, etc. And we shall see that when we operationalize these patterns with AlgebraicJulia, we end up in a very different position with regards to the `DANGLING EDGE CONDITION`.\n",
