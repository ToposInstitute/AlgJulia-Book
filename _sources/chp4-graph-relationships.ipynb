    "A given schema will generally have many instances. We can think of the set of all theses instances as a swamr of thought bubbles - all the graphs this schema might refer to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every schema has a colletion of instances. We can imagine collecting them all into on big pile. Everything the schema might possibly refer to. In our ongoing quest to think about things in terms of relationships we will ask, \"How are these instance related to one another?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will define a useful way of relating instances of a schema. Once we do, we will be ready to move up the last rung or in our ladder of abstactions, from schemas to categories. Yet another kind of directed graph at yet another level of abstraction (our last, mercifully!).\n",

    "## 1. Graph Injections\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 1 we saw an example of a directed graph which described the layout of a ski resort. In this account, you could ride the ski lift up and down the mountain or ski from the top of the mountain into a nearby village.\n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose we visit this ski resort in the Summer when there's no snow. At this time of year the resort lets guests ride up and down the mountain in the lift (which provides a *lovely* view!), but there is no way to get down the mountain into the village without a snow pack to ski on.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the Summer graph is basically contained inside of the Winter graph. How should we characterize this relationship?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we thought about relationships in terms of maps. We can do something similar here. For the Summer graph to be a \"part\" of the Winter graph means, in effect, that we can map the Summer graph *into* the Winter graph, taking vertices to vertices and arrows to arrows.\n",

    "We call this a \"graph injection\". In order to visualize injections clearly let's introduce some new visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figuratively:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's step away from the ski lodge and look at graph injections more generally. We want to represent the injection of graph 1 into graph 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's redesign graph 2 to be a \"recipient\" of the graph 1, moving the colors and shapes out of the way.\n",

    "This gives us an image of \"what went where\" in our injection. We sometimes call this the \"image\" of the first graph in the second.\n",

    "It's important to understand that a graph is not allowed to come apart when getting injected. An arrow must stay attached to its source and target vertices through this process.\n",

    "In chapter 1 we used source and target maps to describe a directed graph. Maps can also be used to describe an injection. In this case the a “vertex map” and an “arrow map” run vertically, telling where each vertex and arrow ends up in the injection.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These two maps capture all the relevant information about the injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our dangling edge condition: For these maps to represent a proper injection the arrows must stay attached to their source and target vertices. Clearly the above maps must work together in some way to prevent breakage. What conditions must be true in order to ensure that a graph doesn't come apart on entry?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this, let's arrange our maps into a square, with the source maps for graph 1 and graph 2 running horizontally and the “arrow map” and “vertex map” running vertically :\n",

    "\n",
    "Note how the dashed lines seem to flow “out” from the arrows in the upper left and flow “in” to the vertices at the lower right. Starting from any given arrow there are two paths you can take around this square, an upper route and a lower route. Let's focus on a specific arrow and consider what these routes “mean”. (We'll label the endpoints as \"A\" and \"V\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upper Route ###\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading across the top we have that the red arrow has the heart as its source. Reading down the right side we see that the heart gets sent to the square vertex in graph 2. So the square is \"the vertex that receives A's source.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Reading down the left we have that the red arrow from graph 1 gets sent to the blue arrow from graph 2 (In other words, the blue arrow is its \"image\"). Reading across the bottom we see that the blue arrow has the square vertex as its source. So the square is \"the source of the image of A.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now revisit to our dangling edge condition. “Coming apart” means, literally, that a vertex and an arrow that were connected in graph 1 are not connected when they land in graph 2. Suppose an arrow gets separated from its source by an attempted injection. For that arrow, the two routes around the square look like this:\n",

    ":width: 500px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, what it “means” for a graph to get broken is precisely that “the vertex that receives A's source” is *different* from “The vertex that is the source of A's image.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we can actually DEFINE what we mean by a graph injection as a square in which all arrows have closed loops going either way around.\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, the same maps must also have closed loops for the arrows and their targets. Together, all of the “data” describing this embedding is caputred in the following diagrams:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have defined one thing – graph connectivity in injections – in terms of another thing – closed loops. Imposing the rule that the certain loops must close is called a \"commutativity condition\".\n",

    "The schema for this data looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "But recall that there was an extra \"loop condition\" that the maps needed to satisfy in order to represent a proper graph morphism:\n",

    "Note how the top of this square contains the schema for Graph 1, the bottom is the schema for graph 2, and the overall square schema represents a morphism of graph 1 into graph 2 _if and only if_ these maps satisfy the closed loop condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our schema, we will impose this closed loop condition by writing it as an equation. We can describe the two paths around the schema in writing by listing the sequence of chunky arrows along each path, S2•A for the lower route and V•S1 for the upper route.\n",

    "(Note how the order in which we write the arrows seems backwards from the order in which you would actually traverse those arrows along the route. Unfortunately this is the notational convention! One way to think of it is to read the symbol • as the word \"after.\" So \"V•S2\" is understood to mean \"V after S2.\")\n",
    "We express our closed loop condition by saying that these two paths must be equal, and we write this equation next to our schema.\n",

    "The upper part of the diagram describes a graph. The lower part of the diagram describes another. And any pair of vertical arrows that satisfy the commutativity constraint describe a way of morphing the first graph into the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data of a schema includes both the pattern of arrows and this equation. The arrows show us the pattern of maps which may form an instance. The equation provides and additional constraint on which collections of maps can be considered valid instances of the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand this to mean that, first of all, any instance of this schema consists of a bunch of maps \"under the hood\" which are arranged in the pattern. But additionally, we have a guarantee that if we inspect those maps we will find a closed loops, of the sort characterized by the equation. Any ways of filling in the schema that do not satisfy the commutativity constraint are not considered valid instances of this schema.\n",

    "\n",
    "Point out that Schemas ARE directed graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have thus taken a geometric idea - the condition that certain loops must all be closed - and have found a way to represent it as an equation. And one nice thing about equations is that they can be easily communicated to a computer! Indeed, if you go back to the last chapter you see that we have \n",

    "We have seen that it is possible to express the geometric idea of graph morphisms in terms of a commutativity constraint on a schema. But this isn't the only thing that can be expressed this way. A surprising and lovely fact of life is that an enormous number of ideas can be captured using schemas and constraints. Let's look at some other examples.\n",

    "It turns out there are a lot of ideas that can be captured by connecting maps together and then declaring some commutativity conditions. Commutative diagrams are the bread and butter of category theory. We will not explore the general notion of commutativity in much depth here. For a thorough yet elementary introduction to this topic we recommend Lawvere and Schanuel's *Conceptual Mathematics*.[^1]\n",

    "As we'll see, one of the benefits of describing injections and dangling edge conditions in terms of maps is that maps and commutativity conditions are easy for the computer to understand maps and inspect.
