    "\n",
    "In our ongoing quest to think about things in terms of relationships we can ask, \"How are these instance related to one another?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will define a useful way of relating instances of a schema. Once we do, we will be ready to move up the last rung or in our ladder of abstactions, from schemas to categories. Yet another kind of directed graph at yet another level of abstraction (our last, mercifully!).\n",

    "## 1. Graph Injections\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 1 we saw an example of a directed graph which described the layout of a ski resort. In this account, you could ride the ski lift up and down the mountain or ski from the top of the mountain into a nearby village.\n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose we visit this ski resort in the Summer when there's no snow. At this time of year the resort lets guests ride up and down the mountain in the lift (which provides a *lovely* view!), but there is no way to get down the mountain into the village without a snow pack to ski on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare the summer and winter maps for the ski resort.\n",

    "\n",
    "One way to think about the relationship between these two graphs is that we can turn one into the other. Given the Summer map I can _turn it into_ the winter map by adding the additional vertices and arrows associated with travelling to the village. On the other hand, vien the Winter map, I can create the summer map by _deleting_ the arrows and vertices associated with the village.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a procedural way of looking at the Summer and Winter maps, a procedure that could be applied to transform one into the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our ongoing quest to think about things in terms of their relationships instead of in terms of the things themselves, we are going to recommedn another way of looking at these two graphs. Note how the Summer graph is basically contained inside of the Winter graph. How should we characterize this relationship? For the Summer graph to be a \"part\" of the Winter graph means, in effect, that we can map the Summer graph *into* the Winter graph, taking vertices to vertices and arrows to arrows.\n",

    "Let's step away from the ski lodge and look at graph injections more generally. We want to represent the injection of graph 1 into graph 2:\n",

    "In chapter 1 we used source and target maps to describe a directed graph. Maps can also be used to describe an injection. In this case the a “vertex map” and an “arrow map” run vertically, telling where each vertex and arrow ends up in the injection.\n",

    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "These two maps capture all the relevant information about the injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our dangling edge condition: For these maps to represent a proper injection the arrows must stay attached to their source and target vertices. Clearly the above maps must work together in some way to prevent breakage. What conditions must be true in order to ensure that a graph doesn't come apart on entry?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this, let's arrange our maps into a square, with the source maps for graph 1 and graph 2 running horizontally and the “arrow map” and “vertex map” running vertically :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the dashed lines seem to flow “out” from the arrows in the upper left and flow “in” to the vertices at the lower right. Starting from any given arrow there are two paths you can take around this square, an upper route and a lower route. Let's focus on a specific arrow and consider what these routes “mean”. (We'll label the endpoints as \"A\" and \"V\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upper Route ###\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} assets//Ch3/UpperRoute.gif\n",
    ":alt: Whoopsy!\n",
    ":width: 500px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading across the top we have that the red arrow has the heart as its source. Reading down the right side we see that the heart gets sent to the square vertex in graph 2. So the square is \"the vertex that receives A's source.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lower Route ###\n",
    "\n",

    ":alt: Whoopsy!\n",
    ":width: 500px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading down the left we have that the red arrow from graph 1 gets sent to the blue arrow from graph 2 (In other words, the blue arrow is its \"image\"). Reading across the bottom we see that the blue arrow has the square vertex as its source. So the square is \"the source of the image of A.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now revisit to our dangling edge condition. “Coming apart” means, literally, that a vertex and an arrow that were connected in graph 1 are not connected when they land in graph 2. Suppose an arrow gets separated from its source by an attempted injection. For that arrow, the two routes around the square look like this:\n",
    "\n",

    ":width: 500px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, what it “means” for a graph to get broken is precisely that “the vertex that receives A's source” is *different* from “The vertex that is the source of A's image.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we can actually DEFINE what we mean by a graph injection as a square in which all arrows have closed loops going either way around.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, the same maps must also have closed loops for the arrows and their targets. Together, all of the “data” describing this embedding is captured in the following diagrams:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have defined one thing – graph connectivity in injections – in terms of another thing – closed loops. Imposing the rule that the certain loops must close is called a \"commutativity condition\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rearrange all of these maps into a single assembly like so:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the top of this square contains the schema for Graph 1, the bottom is the schema for graph 2, and the overall square schema represents a morphism of graph 1 into graph 2 _if and only if_ these maps satisfy the closed loop condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upper part of the diagram describes a graph. The lower part of the diagram describes another. And any pair of vertical arrows that satisfy the commutativity constraint describe a way of morphing the first graph into the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our schema, we will impose this closed loop condition by writing it as an equation. We can describe the two paths around the schema in writing by listing the sequence of chunky arrows along each path, `src 2`•`arr` for the lower route and `vert`•`src 1` for the upper route. And similarly for the targets.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We express our closed loop condition by saying that these two paths must be equal, and we write this equation next to our schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that it is possible to express the geometric idea of graph morphisms in terms of a commutativity constraint on a schema. But this isn't the only thing that can be expressed this way. A surprising and lovely fact of life is that an enormous number of ideas can be captured using schemas and constraints. Let's look at some other examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out there are a lot of ideas that can be captured by connecting maps together and then declaring some commutativity conditions. Commutative diagrams are the bread and butter of category theory. We will not explore the general notion of commutativity in much depth here. For a thorough yet elementary introduction to this topic we recommend Lawvere and Schanuel's *Conceptual Mathematics*.[^1]\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll see, one of the benefits of describing injections and dangling edge conditions in terms of maps is that maps and commutativity conditions are easy for the computer to understand maps and inspect. This allows the computer a way to be of use to us without that computer needing to have any actual understanding ideas like vertices, arrows, attachments..the semantics of graphs.\n",

    "The vertex and arrow maps for our graph injections were all one-to-one. Each vertext in graph 1 was sent to a unique vertix in graph 2, and similarly each arrow was sent to a unique destination.\n",

    "In general, any collection of maps satisfying our schema are called \"graph morphisms.\" Graph injections are a special case of graph morphisms in whcih teh arrow and vertex maps are one-to-one.\n",

    "As it turns out, Alice and Bob are both right handed while Tuco is left handed. Thus, there is another directed graph which also accurately describes the chore progression, but now in terms of the handedness of dish-washer.\n",

    "The second model is a \"course grained\" version of the first. It is consistent with the first model but contains fewer details (ie it does not tell us which right handed person is doing the dishes). We can describe this course grained relationship in terms of closed loops as well.\n",

    "Let's construct a map that connects the Alice, Bob and Tuco (the vertices of the top directed graph) with their handedness (the vertices of the lower graph).\n",
