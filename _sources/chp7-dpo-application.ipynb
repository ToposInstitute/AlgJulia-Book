    "# Chapter 7: Double-Pushout Rewriting Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, Double-pushout (DPO) rewriting is a concept that gives us access to the feature of adding and deleting elements in our data. At its core, DPO rewriting involves the use of two colimits in the $\\mathsf{C}$-Set category that transforms one $\\mathsf{C}$-Set object to another. This process can model a wide range of changes in schema-backed data, from the reconfiguration of physical objects to transformations in world knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Cube Configuration\n",
    "Consider a scenario where the index category, $\\mathsf{C}$, represents the schema for a three-dimensional (3D) shape, comprising three fundamental objects: `Face`, `Edge`, `Vertex`. This schema is enriched with six non-identity morphisms: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `src`, `tgt`, which define the relationships between these objects. DPO rewriting in this context can model various transformations of a 3D object including cube,or box. \n",

This operation would involve redefining the relationships between the Faces and Edges objects to \"remove\" the connections that form the top face. Similarly, unfolding the cube into a flat layout would radically alter the connections between Faces, Edges, and Vertices to represent the cube in an unfolded state.

We can say that it's closed by explaining how the faces, edges, and vertices are defined relative to one another. In a cube, there are exactly six faces, which we can call `f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6`. Faces have exactly four edges, which we call the top, bottom, left, and right edges. Edges can also have names, such as `e1, e2, e3, e4, ...`. If we want to say the top of edge of `f1` is `e1`, then we can refer to the schema and express the the following part:\n",
