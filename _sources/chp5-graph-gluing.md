# Chapter 5: Combining Graphs

:::{attention}
This chapter will engage you in deep relational thinking! 
:::

## 5.1. Introduction

So far, we have seen that graphs are a quite simple and powerful tool to model relationships between various entities. We also learnt the idea of identifying one graph inside another via a graph morphism. A graph morphism may coarse-grain the information in the domain graph by sending two different vertices/edge of the domain to the same vertex/edge in the codomain but it always **preserves the connectivity** of the domain. Finally, excitingly, with graph morphisms, we enter the "universe" where we can find every possible "graph-world" and every possible relationships between these worlds. In this chapter, we "live" inside this universe where the only entities are graphs and morphisms between them.

Inside this universe, we are interested to know how to combine two graphs, like adding two numbers (if this analogy sounds odd to you, towards the end of this chapter we will see that adding numbers is same as combining two discrete graphs). The utilitiy of combining graphs is to bridge islands of connections allowing for information to flow between the graphs (via common channels) and for expression of new meanings.

As a step towards making sense of the idea of combining graphs, let us a revisit a graph that we met in the first chapter — “Whose turn is it to do dishes?”.

```{image} assets/Ch5/DGdishes.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 800px
:align: center
```
</br>

In this graph, Paul claimed to be friends with Tuco (to our unaware readers, Tuco is Paul’s neighbor’s cat). Paul is also a friend of Brendan, Angeline and Priyaa (co-authors of this book). Encoding these friendships as graphs, we get:

```{image} assets/Ch5/3c.jpeg
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 560px
:align: center
```

Read each edge in the above graphs as “is a friend of”. Combining the above two friendship graphs along the common vertex Paul into a single friendship graph, we get:

```{image} assets/Ch5/3b.jpeg
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 460px
:align: center
```
</br>

We see new information emerging in the combined graph. Tuco “is a friend of a friend” for Brendan, Priyaa, and Angeline. If we assume that a friend of a friend is a friend, then one can infer that Tuco “is a friend of” Brendan, Angeline and Priyaa. The connections in the combined graph supports such assumptions and inferences.

The above example is deceivingly simple. By eyeballing the two friendship graphs, it is easy to see by common experience how the graphs can be combined. But, graphs generated in the real world are quite complex [^1]. 
```{image} assets/Ch5/complex-graph.png
:alt: Whoopsy!

```
<center> A graph generated by real-world data </center>

</br>

In practice, combining such graphs using pen and paper is out question! However, it is the same common sense that is in play combining even the most complex graphs.

The goal of this chapter is to make our inherent sense of combining graphs more explicit and fun! Once explicit, we all can agree unambiguously what does it mean to combine two graphs together. We will achieve this goal by playing a game of dumb charades of graphs using memes from relational thinking (popularly known as category theory)! 

The challenge of this game is to communicate “the connectivity of any combined graph” without explicitly saying what the graph is! This is because, while in the universe we can talk (only) about relationships between graphs. Once we look inside a graph, we will no longer be in the universe but we would be inside a graph-world which is unaware of any other (graph) worlds. A *combined* graph needs to be aware of the graphs which it combined (otherwise it just any old graph). So, we need to stay in the level of universe to talk about combining graphs!

## 5.2. Combining graphs using memes

The two memes we will use to play this game are, 1. Commuting diagrams, and 2. Graph isomorphisms.

Having explored the idea of commuting diagrams and sameness in the previous chapter, we are now ready to play! 

Let us first introduce some **terminology**: we call a combined graph of two overlapping graphs as their `pushout`.

:::{admonition} Game description 
:class: attention

**Goal:** To describe the `pushout` of any two (overlapping) graphs!

**Rule:** Description of a `pushout` MUST NOT include its vertices, edges, source and target maps.

:::

A `pushout` (of two overlapping graphs) is a graph in the space of all possible graphs. We need to spot that graph in this space! We will narrow down our search step-by-step using the memes we have learnt. We will continue this process until we end up with the graph we are looking for. 

We will draw lots and lots of diagrams for this narrowing down process! Diagrams are basic to relational thinking!

Let us begin!

### The shape of the overlap

To combine two graphs, we first need to know which vertices and edges are common to both the graphs. Recollect that the “Paul” vertex was common to both the friendship graphs we met early in the chapter. 

We saw in previous chapters that a graph morphism identifies one graph inside another. Suppose we are given two graphs -- `graph A` and `graph B`. An overlap of these two graphs is specified as the diagram below: a diagram with two radiating arrows, one into `graph A` and another one into `graph B`. Graph `overlap` specifies the vertices and edges common to `graph A` and `graph B`! Note that a relational specification of common vertices and edges as shown below ensures that the overlapping region will be a graph by itself (no dangling edges)!

```{image} assets/Ch5/1.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
</br>

The relationships between the graphs in the above diagram are: 

- `overlap` maps into `graph A`.
- `overlap` maps into `graph B`.
- Thus, the regions in which `overlap` maps into `graph A` and `graph B` are common to the two graphs.
 
(The morphisms in the above diagram are injective, but in general they need not be so! Connecitivity matters!)

The `overlap` acts as a bridge between two graphs. Theoretically, presence of an overlap means that we can navigate from one graph to the other via common vertices and edges. That is, we can combine `graph A` and `graph B` into a single graph. This idea of a combining graphs can be loosely illustrated as sticking together two sheets of paper using glue.

```{image} assets/Ch5/sheets.jpeg
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 250px
:align: center
```

Another (closer) analogy that comes to mind for combining graphs is glueing a broken handle to a tea cup using two pieces of glue. 

```{image} assets/Ch5/4.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 450px
:align: center
```

With this analogy in mind, let us think of the `pushout` of a (overlap) diagram with two radiating graph morphisms!  

:::{admonition} Key points
:class: tip

A diagram with two radiating maps into two graphs is a specification of an overlap of those graphs.

Overlapping graphs can be glued together.

:::



### Pass 1: Commuting square

Now that, we know the overlap, the next step in this game is to narrow down some potential candidates for the `pushout`. Right now, it could be any graph in the universe!

We cannot talk about `pushout` (graph) individually in terms of its source and target maps since we are in Rung 4. Hence, we will look at the `pushout` from the perspective of some other graphs. That is, we are going to ask a few other graphs we are familiar with (in this setting) that,

> *How is the `pushout` related to you?*

> An old spanish saying goes like this. *Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are!*

The most immediate candidates for this enquiry are `graph A` and `graph B` since the `pushout` is given by combining `graph A` and `graph B` (along `overlap`). 

:::{admonition} Pause and ponder!
If you are `graph A`, how do you expect yourself to be related to the `pushout`? 
:::

We invite the reader to take a moment to ponder over this question using the picture below.

```{image} assets/Ch5/2.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 450px
:align: center
```

Since the `pushout` is given by glueing `graph A` and `graph B` along the shape of `overlap`, at the least, there must: 

1. `graph A` must map into the `pushout` (the cup is in the glued object). 
2. `graph B` must map into the `pushout` (the handle is in the glued object). 

Let us add these morphisms to the overlap diagram:

```{image} assets/Ch5/3.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 450px
:align: center
```
<center> Diagram: Four arrows </center>

</br>

Does this shape look vaguely familiar? If this reminds of you of commuting diagrams, Hurray!! Let us first just look at the diagram. There are two paths from `overlap` to the `pushout`.

So, `overlap` can be indentified inside the `pushout` in two ways: 

- either through `graph A`,
- or through `graph B`.

:::{admonition} Pause and ponder!

Which one of these is the correct way to identify `overlap` inside the `pushout`? 

:::

Do you see that 'irrespective of the path, `overlap` IS EXPECTED TO be indentified precisely in the same region in the `pushout` because it is common to both `graph A` and `graph B`'? Hence, the overlap must map into the same region of the pushout irrespective of the path.

```{image} assets/Ch5/GluedObject.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 250px
:align: center
```

In the cup-handle analogy, this is analogous to saying that the points in the cup and the points in the handle which are glued together are indistinguishable in the glued object (blue points).  The rest of the points can be distinguished as belonging to the cup (green points) or to the handle (orange points). 

> 'Irrespective of the path, `overlap` IS EXPECTED TO be indentified precisely in the same region in the `pushout` because it is common to both `graph A` and `graph B`' = The  diagram with four arrows MUST COMMUTE!

Thus, our enquiry to `graph A` and `graph B` have resulted in a condition that a candidate for `pushout` MUST satisfy! That is, "Diagram: Four arrows" must commute.


:::{admonition} Key points

1. `graph A` must map into the `pushout` (yellow arrow from `graph A`). 
2. `graph B` must map into the `pushout` (yellow arrow from `graph B`). 
3. The diagram MUST COMMUTE!

:::

### Pass 2: Universal Property

While not all graphs can make up such a commuting square of `pushout`, there can more than one graph that can produce a commuting square.

:::{admonition} Puzzle

Find at least two graphs which will make the diagram commute. 

```{image} assets/Ch5/1.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

:::

As the previous exercise demonstrates, there can be many different graphs that makes the diagram commute. So, we must narrow down further. We will follow the same technique of asking other graphs, 

> *What is your relationship with the `pushout`?*

So, to which graphs should we ask the above question? We have already covered `graph A`, `graph B`, `overlap` and have ended up with some potential candidates. The `pushout` we are looking for is inside this candidates set!  We shall ask the graphs in set, "What is your relationship with the `pushout`?"

To do so, we are going to do step outside the game for a moment and sharpen our instinct about `pushout`s. For this, we will say concretely what `overlap`, `graph A` and `graph B`!

```{image} assets/Ch5/6.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

The `overlap` maps into `graph A` and `graph B` as follows:

```{image} assets/Ch5/1.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

A few possible choices of `pushout` graphs of the above diagram are: 

(1) Is the following a commuting diagram?

```{image} assets/Ch5/7a.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

(2) Is the following a commuting diagram?

```{image} assets/Ch5/7b.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

(3) Is the following a commuting diagram?

```{image} assets/Ch5/7c.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

(4) Is the following a commuting diagram?

```{image} assets/Ch5/7d.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

We invite the reader to to have a careful look at each choice and convince oneself that each of these diagrams commute. 

:::{admonition} Pause and Ponder! 

Which one the graphs inside the yellow boxes will be your choice for `pushout`?

:::

We want the `pushout` to be “the most natural choice” among all possible choices of graphs. By most natural, we mean a choice which will follow “the principle of least effort (to integrate)” or the “path of least resistance” (as nature does). 

**In the above graphs, which one is your most natural choice for a `pushout` and why?** 

While we will reveal our choice in a moment, let us have a look at each one of the choices. 

- In `choice 1`, except for the overlaps, the vertices and edges from `graph A`, and the vertices and the edges from `graph B` are clearly distinguishable. The information of `graph A` and `graph B` remain intact (except at the overlap).
- In `choice 2`, the boundaries of `graph A` and `graph B` fade beyond the overlap region.
- In `choice 3`, there is an extra vertex and an edge.
- `choice 4` represents maximal collapse of information - all the vertices and edges from `graph A` and `graph B` are squeezed into a single vertex and edge in the possible graph.

`choice 1` has the feeling of *the most lazy choice* since `graph A` and `graph B` are kept seperate except for the overlap region. It does nothing extra like coarse-graining information like `choice 2` and "choice D", or to add extra information like `choice 3`. Indeed `choice 1` is our choice! 

We shall now make our intuition of *least effort* precise by asking, 

> What is the relationship of `choice 1` with all the other choices, and vice versa?

Let's begin our quest for these relationships!

---
|| `choice 1` **vs** `choice 2` ||

```{image} assets/Ch5/8a.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```
</br>

We have two commuting diagrams - one with `choice 1` and another one with `choice 2`. Next we see how they are related with each other.

```{image} assets/Ch5/8b.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

</br>

There are many graph morphisms from graph `choice 1` to graph `choice 2`. But there is exactly one arrow (dotted) that will make the 2 three-sided diagrams (2 triangles) formed by two yellow arrows and the dotted arrow commute. This dotted arrow is again the most intuitive one, mapping blue vertices/edges to blue, green vertices/edges to green, orange to orange. This arrow from `choice 1` to `choice 2` is dotted to signify that there is only one such morphism. 

> The above diagram has 4 commuting diagrams pasted together (including the 2 squares [^2] starting at `overlap`). Commuting diagrams are like ecosystems in balance. When ecosystems are pasted together along their edges, any change in one ecosystem will create a change in the other. When the “most natural” information flows along the morphisms, all the ecosystems are in balance.

[^2]: A four-sided commuting diagram

```{image} assets/Ch5/8c.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```
</br>

Now for the other direction, are there maps from `choice 2` to `choice 1` all possible closed shapes in the above diagram will commute simultaneously? Nope, there is no such embedding — the orange-green vertex of `choice 2` can be mapped to either the orange or the green vertex of `choice 1`. If it is mapped into the orange vertex, then the upper triangle does not commute. If it is mapped into the green vertex, then the lower triangle does not commute. Since `choice 2` has coarse-grained the information of `graph A` and `graph B`, the information cannot be fine-grained again! So no map in the backwards direction!

**Score** `choice 1`: 1,  `choice 2`: 0

---
|| `choice 1` **vs** `choice 3` ||

```{image} assets/Ch5/9b.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```
</br>

As before, there is exactly one (obvious) choice of morphism from `choice 1` to `choice 3` that will make the triangles commute. 

```{image} assets/Ch5/9c.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```
</br>

However, there are at least two ways in `choice 3` maps into `choice 1` to make the triangles commute. The grey vertex in `choice 3` can be mapped to one of the two blue vertices in `choice 1`. Both these choices are equally good! Because, `choice 3` has extra information, that is a vertex and an edge neither from `graph A` nor from `graph B`, there is more than one way of mapping this extra information into the most lazy `choice 1`.



**Score** `choice 1`: 1, `choice 4`: 0

---
|| `choice 1` **vs** `choice 4` ||


```{image} assets/Ch5/10b.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

As before, there is exactly one (obvious) choice of morphism from `choice 1` to `choice 4` that will make the triangles commute. 

```{image} assets/Ch5/10c.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

However, `choice 4` does not embed in `choice 1` because of its self-loop. 

**Score** `choice 1`: 1,  `choice 4`: 0

Our choice of a `pushout` graph having such <mark>universal nature</mark> is an indication that we got our plumbing right and things will flow smoothly! In category theory, this is called a universal property of an object. 

:::{tip}
Universal property is the mathematical name for "harmony" of relationships.
:::


Whewww!! That is some hard core relational thinking!

:::{admonition} Key points
:class: tip

The `pushout` satisfies a universal property: the `pushout` has a unique arrow into any other graph which satisfies Pass 1, such that two triangles commute!

```{image} assets/Ch5/13b.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

:::

### Pass 3: Uniqueness

We have progressed quite a bit! Let us review our progress so far! In this game, to begin with, a `pushout` could be any graph in the space of all possible graphs. 

**Pass 1: Commuting square**:- 
```{image} assets/Ch5/13a.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

By asking `overlap`, `graph A`, and `graph B`, "What is your relationship with the `pushout`?", we narrowed down a set of candidates for the `pushout` from the space of all graphs. Each one of these candidates (`graph X`) make the above diagram commute!


**Pass 2: Universal property**:-
```{image} assets/Ch5/13b.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

 By asking same question to all the candidates that made through Pass 1, we narrowed down the candidates to those which satisfy the universal property: which have exactly one morphism into any other candidate such that the two triangles (in the above diagram) commute simultaneously. 

Now, 

> We repeat the same procedure of asking "What is your relationship with the `pushout`?" on the remaining candidates (candidates which satisfy both the requirements)! 

```{image} assets/Ch5/slogan.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

Our goal is to finally end up with one `pushout` graph!! Recall that the `pushout` we are looking for is one among the remaining candidates. 

Suppose some `graph X` made it through Pass 2 along with the `pushout`. What is its relationship with the `pushout`?

Both `graph X` and the `pushout` satisfy the commuting square requirement of Pass 1. However, `graph X` is universal (satisfies the universal property). So, `graph X` must have a unique map into the `pushout` that makes the triangles commute. 

```{image} assets/Ch5/16b.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

However, the `pushout` is also universal. So it must have a unique map into `graph X` that makes the triangles commute. 

```{image} assets/Ch5/16a.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

However, all the commuting shapes of pass 1 and pass 2 tell us that these two maps between the `pushout` and `graph X` are inverse of each other -- isormorphisms (If are interested in the reasoning, check the box below. )! In other words, THE `pushout` AND `graph X` ARE ONE AND THE SAME!! All the candidates which made through Pass 2 are isomorphic! We have found our pushout!!

:::{admonition} Why the two unique maps are isomorphisms?
:class: dropdown

````{div} wrapper 
In the above diagrams, the `pushout` has a unique mapping into `graph X`, and `graph X` has a unique mapping into X2. These two maps make all the four triangles commute in unison! 

```{image} assets/Ch5/17a.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

Since the upper two triangles commute in the above diagram, the upper triangle in the below diagram commutes. Similarly for the lower triangle. 

```{image} assets/Ch5/17b.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

There is one other arrow from the `pushout` to `pushout` which can make the above diagram commute: The “be-as-you-are” arrow (that which maps each vertex to itself and each edge to itself):
```{image} assets/Ch5/17c.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

Because the map `pushout` —> `graph X` —> `pushout`  is unique, there is ONLY ONE arrow which makes the two (big) triangles commute. However, we have two mappings. So, both of them should be the same!   Hence, 
```{image} assets/Ch5/18a.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
```

“Graph X1 —> Graph X2 —> Graph X1” and “be-as-you-are” arrows are the same.

Similarly, we can prove that “Graph X2 —> Graph X1 —> Graph X2” and “be-as-you-are” arrows are the same: 
```{image} assets/Ch5/18b.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 500px
:align: center
````
:::


:::{important}

Note that Pass 3 did NOT impose any requirement like Pass 1 and Pass 2 to narrow down candidates. The result of Pass 3 that all candidates which made through Pass 1 and Pass 2 are isomorphic is a consequence of the existing requirements.

A pushout is any graph which makes it through Pass 2 (and Pass 1).

## 5.4. What is a pushout?

The goal game was to say describe the `pushout` of an overlap diagram is without talking about its connectivity (vertices and edges). We used the relationships between various graphs and the `pushout` to describe what the `pushout` must be! Let us summarize our description of `pushout` of an overlap diagram. 

We start with `overlap` with two radiating morphisms specifying the common vertices and edges of `graph A` and `graph B`. We call this an *overlap diagram*.

```{image} assets/Ch5/19a.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 350px
:align: center
```

We compute the `pushout` of an overlap diagram. The `pushout` is a graph which satisfies:

**Pass 1: Commuting square** :-  The following square must commute.

```{image} assets/Ch5/13a.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 450px
:align: center
```
</br>

**Pass 2: Universal property**: For any other choice of graph which satisfies Pass 1's requirement, there is exactly one (a unique) map from the `pushout` into that choice such that the triangles commute. 

```{image} assets/Ch5/19c.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 450px
:align: center
```
</br>

As a consequence of these requirements, all graphs which satisfy both these requirements **are “practically the same”**.

Relational thinking narrows down a solution from the space of all sensible structures by methodically reflecting on “WHAT” is that we are looking for rather focusing on “HOW” to construct a solution and verify that the construction will always produce a sensible structure.  

In this sense, relational thinking is non-invasive!

:::

## 5.5. Puzzle time! 

Let us compute the `pushout` of the following diagrams.

**Puzzle 1. Pushout using a single vertex**

:::


**Puzzle 2. Pushout using a single edge**

This one is a little tricky, because the two vertices (”A” and “B”) in `overlap` embeds into the same vertex of `graph B` (”A,B”), thereby coarse-graining the information in `overlap`. However, vertices “A” and “B” in `overlap` embeds in separate vertices in `graph A`. So, how would the overlap region look in the `pushout` graph?

Since `graph A` and `graph B` has to agree in the overlap region, and `graph B` has only coarse-grained embedding of `overlap`, the embedding of `graph A` in the `pushout`, coarse-grains the overlap region of `graph A` to match the overlap region of `graph B`.

**Puzzle 3. Pushout using a empty graph**

In the beginning of this chapter, we said that combining graphs is analogous to adding numbers. Can you see how this problem demonstrates this analogy?

(An empty graph is the graph with its set of vertices and the set of edges to be empty set. The sources and the target maps sends “no vertex” to “no edge”.)

When there is no glue (graph O is empty), the `pushout` just has `graph A` and `graph B` side by side with no bridge in between them. `graph A` has three vertices and no edges. `graph B` has two vertices and no edges. The `pushout` has 5 vertices which is the sum of vertices in `graph A` and vertices in `graph B`. Sum of two numbers is just a `pushout` . Isn't that cool ?!

**Ex 4. Finite Pushout**

Let us suppose, we want to glue more than two graphs together! That seems to be a reasonable ask! So we got a diagram like the one below. 

```{image} assets/Ch5/23.png

What are the requirements for a graph to be `pushout` of the above diagram?

## 5.6. Computing pushouts in Algebraic Julia

In the previous section, we hand-computed the pushout of the diagrams. This section shows how we can program a computer to compute pushout using Algebraic Julia. The reader is welcomed to run each of these code snippets and verify the output with their pushout graphs!


### Puzzle 1

```{code-cell}
# Puzzle 1
#-----------

# Puzzle 1
#-----------

using Catlab

# Graph with a single isolated vertex
Overlap1 = SymmetricGraph(1)
# Create a triangle
graphA = cycle_graph(SymmetricGraph, 3)
# Initialize this graph as an isolated edge
graphB = path_graph(SymmetricGraph, 2)
# Then modify it to add a loop to vertex #2
add_edge!(graphB, 2, 2)

# There are three possible morphisms from the isolated vertex into a graph
# with three vertices. Because these three vertices are equivalent due to
# the symmetry of the triangle, it doesn't matter which one we pick. So,
# rather than manually specifying how Overlap1 matches to parts of graph A, we
# use the automatic homomorphism search which will pick an arbitrary one.
graphA_map = homomorphism(Overlap1, graphA)

# Because the two vertices of graph B are *not* equivalent (one has a loop,
# the other doesn't) we have to be more precise in our construction of
# the map from Overlap1 into graph B. The only data required is saying where
# the vertex of Overlap1 is mapped to. We send it to vertex#1, which is
# the one which does *not* have a loop.
graphB_map = ACSetTransformation(Overlap1, graphB; V=[1])

# Glue together graph A and graph B along their common overlap, Overlap1
pushout_graph = colimit(Span(graphA_map, graphB_map));

# Visualize the result
to_graphviz(apex(pushout_graph))
```

Use the code cell at the end of the section to visualize `graph A` and `graph B`.


### Puzzle 2

```{code-cell}
# Puzzle 2
#-----------

using Catlab

# Our overlap is an isolated edge
Overlap2 = path_graph(SymmetricGraph, 2)
# Create a triangle
graphA = cycle_graph(SymmetricGraph, 3)
# Initialize this graph as an isolated edge
graphB = path_graph(SymmetricGraph, 2)
# Then modify it to add a loop to vertex #2
add_edge!(graphB, 2, 2)

# Again, the three possible morphisms out of Overlap2 (each of
# which picks an edge of the triangle, G2) are equivalent, so
# we don't need to pick a specific one: we let the automatic
# search algorithm find it for us.
graphA_map = homomorphism(Overlap2, graphA)

# Again, we need to be more precise in how we map into G3
# because it matters whether or not the overlapping edge is
# the loop or the other edge. Here, we specify the loop by
# initializing the homomorphism search (via the `initial`
# keyword). In this case, the morphism is fully determined
# once we declare that both vertices of Overlap2 are sent
# to vertex#2 in G3.
graphB_map = homomorphism(Overlap2, graphB; initial=(V=[2, 2],))

# Once again we glue together G2 and G3 along Overlap2
pushout_graph = colimit(Span(graphA_map, graphB_map));

to_graphviz(apex(pushout_graph))
```

Use the code cell at the end of the section to visualize `graph A` and `graph B`.

### Puzzle 3

```{code-cell}
# Puzzle 3

using Catlab

# The graphs here are all discrete (no edges)
Overlap3, graphA, graphB = SymmetricGraph(0), SymmetricGraph(3), SymmetricGraph(2)

# morphisms out of an empty graph are themselves 'empty'
# (they require no data other than the domain and codomain)
graphA_map = ACSetTransformation(Overlap3, graphA)
graphB_map = ACSetTransformation(Overlap3, graphB)
# We glue together the discrete graphs along the empty overlap
pushout_graph = colimit(Span(graphA_map, graphB_map));

## 5.6 Summary 
Congratulations!! You have crossed Chapter 5 successfully!

Things get quite complex and rich quickly as we add relationships and ask the relationships to satisfy more and more constraints. However, once set up right, the tools make life better because all the complex thinking is handled early on eliminating the necessity to think cleverly about the edge cases when the tools is used.  We will demonstrate this idea in the next chapter when we look into the concept of “find and replace” inside graphs! You would be accustomed to using the “find-and-replace” operation in text editors. In the next chapter, we shall apply the idea of “find-and-replace” to graphs by computing pushouts. 

It only gets easier from here!!

[FROM HERE, THE NEXT TWO SECTIONS MUST BE INTRODUCED IN CHAPTER 4.]

We said that we are going to use memes from relational thinking to play this game. Sections 2 and 3 will introduce two such memes from relational thinking.

# Move content below to Chapter 4

## Commuting diagrams: Move to 4

You have met this meme in Chapter 3 when Paul introduced you to graph embeddings. Do you recollect this animation from Chapter 3?

![whoops!](./assets/Ch3/FullHomomorphism.gif)

This animation is an instantiation of two commuting diagrams which define a graph embedding.

We know that a graph is a purposeful (constrained) relationship between edges and vertices. This relationship is a pair of maps: a source and a target map from the set of edges to the set of vertices. A graph embedding is a purposeful relationship between two graphs. This relationship is also a pair of maps: a vertex map between vertices of the graphs and an arrow map between the edges of the graphs. What makes a graph embedding purposeful is its harmonious behavior with the existing source and the target maps in the domain and the codomain. This harmony is precisely encoded as a pair of commuting diagrams.

Let us suppose we have two graphs and a graph embedding between them. So we have the following system maps:

```{image} assets/Ch3/2-commuting-diagram-1.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 450px
:align: center
```

The following two commuting diagrams of graph embedding tells us how these system of maps play with each other. The first diagram tells that the source of each edge in `overlap` is preserved by the embedding. 

```{image} assets/Ch3/2-commuting-diagram-2.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 400px
:align: center
```

The second diagram tells that the target of each edge in `overlap` is preserved by the embedding.

```{image} assets/Ch3/2-commuting-diagram-3.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 400px
:align: center
```

Hey, did you notice that commuting diagrams look like directed graphs?! But they are very specific sort of graphs - they have an *origin* vertex which has only outgoing arrows (Edges of `overlap`), and a *destination* vertex which has only incoming arrows (Vertices of `graph A`). Hence, these graphs are non-cyclic. One follows any arrow from the origin to reach the destination. There are multiple choices of paths to take from the origin (two paths in each of the above diagrams). The word commuting refers to the fact that, for an edge in “Edges of `overlap`”, following any of the path, will lead to the same vertex in “Vertices of `graph A`”. In a commuting diagram, all the paths are practically the same. Commuting diagrams signify diversity of paths but unity of purpose.

Let us see have a closer look at the first commuting diagram.

```{image} assets/Ch3/2-commuting-diagram-4.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 450px
:align: center
```

For any edge in `overlap`, following ‘Path 1’ will lead to the image of its source vertex in `graph A`. For the same edge, following ‘Path 2’ leads to the source vertex of its image in `graph A`. The commuting diagram ensures us that both these vertices are the same. Interpret the second diagram similarly. The commuting diagrams convey that the arrow and the vertices maps are *aware* of the source and the target maps of `overlap` and `graph A`.

Note that there can be any number of graph embeddings between `overlap` and `graph A`. But, all of them follow the commuting diagrams.

Commuting diagrams are more general than for just graph embeddings. Commuting diagrams are of any closed shape like a triangle or a square and are non-cyclic. The arrows of a commuting diagram can belong to any rung: do you remember this picture from Chapter 1?

```{image} assets/Ch3/Ladder.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 400px
:align: center
```

The above commuting diagrams (sort of belongs to rung 3). The vertices are sets (sets of vertices and sets of edges) and the arrows are set functions.

A commuting diagram in rung 4 may look like this:

```{image} assets/Ch3/2-commuting-diagram-5.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
graph O is the origin and graph B is the destination. The above diagram says that embedding the choices of paths to embed `overlap` inside `graph B` are exactly the same. But what does this sameness mean? To make this answer straightforward, let us color the embeddings:

```{image} assets/Ch3/2-commuting-diagram-6.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 400px
:align: center
```
We know that each embedding has an arrows map and vertices map. The commuting diagram tells us that:

1.  For any vertex in `overlap` (drawn as the little blue ball), applying the green embedding to it produces a vertex in `graph B` (green circle surrounding the black circle). Or applying the red embedding produces a vertex in `graph A` (red circle surrounding the black circle); applying the yellow embedding to this vertex produces a vertex in `graph B` (yellow circle surrounding the red circle). Because the diagram commutes, both the vertices in `graph B` are the same.

```{image} assets/Ch3/2-same-vertex-2.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 350px
:align: center
```

2.  For any edge in `overlap` (drawn as a black line), applying the green embedding, or applying red embedding and then a yellow embedding (on the edge produced by the red embedding) will produce the same edge in `graph B`.

```{image} assets/Ch3/2-same-edge.png

## When are two graphs the same?: Move to 4

We already met the idea of “sameness” in the previous section. In our every day conversations, we use the word “same” quite often — 

Brendan eats the same breakfast everyday (probably)! 

Steve Jobs wore the same outfit everyday! 

The word “same” has origin in the Sanskrit word “*sama*” which (sort of) translates to “equal”. The word “sama” invokes an image of a balanced weighing scale in my mind. Growing up in India, it was a common sight for me seeing shopkeepers weighing their produce using such scales.

```{image} assets/Ch3/3-balance.png
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 350px
:align: center
```

The idea of “sameness” or “sama” is that in certain context, two distinguishable objects are considered to be equal or identical — their meaning is considered to be the same. Under the context of color, all the outfits of Steve Jobs were identical / equal (can't be told apart). Under the context of recipe, the breakfast Brendan eats are identical / equal (can't be told apart). 

The ability to blur the lines between the meaning of objects and group them into one, by placing them in a certain context is quite natural to human thinking and is also useful. Imagine a world without weighing scales which is a practical demonstration of “sameness” (under the context of weight)! The concept of “sameness” is an instance of relational thinking in everyday life. 

When someone speaks of sameness of two things, there exists an (unspoken) context hidden in it. The idea of sameness is manifestation of this unspoken context. Relational thinking (in mathematical sense) supports making this context explicit thereby eliminating the room for arguments if two things are same or not. (Eugenia Cheng has explained this very beautifully. I think a reference to her explanation or a video embedding will be very helpful.)

In this section, we want to explore the “sameness of graphs” through the lens of relational thinking. The question of finding out if two graphs are the same is an area of study by itself and beyond the scope of this book. We are more interesting in making explicit the relationship that makes two graphs the same.

Let us play a simple game. Among these three graphs, circle the two graphs which you “think” are the same:

```{image} assets/Ch3/3-same-graphs-1.jpeg
:alt: Whoopsy!
:width: 350px
:align: center
```

Did you circle (b) and (d)? Can you say out loud — 

1. Why did you not circle (a) and (c)? 
    
    [ They are not the same because (c) has more arrows than (a). ]
    
2. Why did you not circle (a) and (b)? 
    
    [ Even though these two graphs have the same number of edges, there seems to be a mismatch in how the vertices are connected! ]
    
3. Why did you circle (b) and (d)? (reshape one into another)
    
    [ They both contain precisely the same connectivity. Because of this, (b) can be "changed" to look like (d) and vice versa by repositioning the vertices and/or the edges. Thus, both the graphs are the same.]

    Graphs (b) and (d) are **isomorphic** -- 'iso' means same, 'morph' means form. (b) and (d) are of same form. 

   (b) and (d) are isomorphic means that there is an embedding of (b) in (d) (shown in red below), and an embedding of (d) in (b) (shown in green) such that one undoes the action of the other. Take any vertex in (b). Follow it through the red followed by the green embedding. You will reach the same vertex you started at (green undoes red). Take any vertex in (d). Follow it through the green followed by the red embedding. You will reach the same vertex you started with (red undoes green). Similarly for the edges.

Before I end this section, I would like to entertain you with a personal story tangentially related to graphs and the idea of sameness! When we were young, my brother and I were very fond of “Maggi noodles”.  My mom considered Maggi noodles to be both unhealthy and expensive. But, because we were fond of it, she would occasionally bring home two packets of these noodles. It was brother’s task to cook these noodles. After cooking, he would spilt the noodles into two portions and I would be given a chance to pick one I wanted. I always had great trouble in making up my mind, since whichever portion I picked, mine looked lesser to me. Often, I would ask to change since my brother’s portion looked bigger. My mom with great annoyance would reply, “Both the portions are the same! It's your eyes which are big!”.
