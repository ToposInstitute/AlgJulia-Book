    "We have now seen how directed graphs can be useful for modeling the world. However, in some situations they're not actually the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we were making a directed graph to represent the social network on Tiktok:\n",
    "* Vertices are people\n",
    "* Arrows are \"follows\", going from a person to someone they follow.\n",

    "In this case, directed graphs are the perfect choice for modeling the social network because TikTok follows are _directional_. Someone you follow may not follow you back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's imagine doing the same thing for connections on LinkedIn. In this social network, both parties must mutually agree to the connection. So a LinkedIn connection is symmetric, not directional.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this kind of social network we need a different kind of graph. We call these \"undirected graphs\" and, as the name surely suggests, these are like directed graphs but with non-directional edges connecting the vertices instead of arrows.\n",

    "### Chunky arrows\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin this chapter with a little tidying up. The basic building block we've been working with so far is a map, a bundle of connections in which every item on one side gets connected to some item on the other. For example:\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A big chunky arrow like this is easier to draw and easier to think about. Whenever we see one we can take for granted that there is some specific set of connections bundled up \"under the hood.\" This is just like in an algebra equation where, when we see the variable 'x', we know it stands for some specific number. Chunky arrows are like variables for maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figures built from these chunky arrows are known as schemas. In moving from an explicit map to its schema, we are moving from rung 2 (\"data\") to rung 3 (\"blueprints\") on our ladder of abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directed graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the schema that represents a directed graph? Recall that a directed graph is defined by two maps, both of which connect the same collections of arrows and vertices. \n",

    "\n",
    "A pair of parallel source and target maps is the underlying pattern that is common to all directed graphs, their essential \"blueprint\". We generally draw this as two arrows marked `src` and `tgt`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Any _particular_ pair of maps between the same arrows and vertices is said to be an \"instance\" of this schema. By filling in the schema in different ways we create different instances, and every instance corresponds to some directed graph.\n",

An important thing to know about this game is that the player always has the option to \"pass.\" That is, one of the available moves at any given turn is to stay in the current state.

In applied settings they are excellent for geometric applications. Reflexive relationships are prevalent in mathematics (divisibility among the integers, subsets among sets, etc.). And in category theory all structures of interest (preorders, categories, etc.) are reflexive graphs.\n",

But the framework we have developed here can actually be extended beyond just graphs, to an extraordinary variety of elaborate and useful concepts. Indeed, one of the profound offerings of AlgebraicJulia is the sheer number of mathematical abstractions it can handle in terms of schemas. In this final section we offer a brief glimpse at some more powerful models and ideas that are also captured by this framework.\n",

    "We can generalize reflexive graphs to higher dimensions using schemas. The result is one of the algebraic topologist's favorite tools: simplicial sets. Ordinary graphs connect 0-dimensional vertices using 1-dimensional lines. With simplicial sets we can also attach 2-dimensional triangles, building up triangulated surfaces. Going up another dimension we can attach 3-dimensional tetrahedra to make solid figures. And so on.\n",

    "For the mathematician, simplicial sets are useful because they turn geometry into algebra: a simplicial triangulation of a topological space is a combinatorial object that can be reasoned about. For the applied scientist, simplicial sets may be useful as a way of 3D modeling, as we'll see in Chapter 7. Finally, in AlgebraicJulia, simplicial sets are practical because all of the rules for how different parts must attach can be fully captured with a few commutativity conditions.\n",

It was developed by German computer scientist Carl Adam Petri in the 1960's, whose goal was to provide a system that could model parallel processes, synchronization, resource sharing, and which had an intuitive graphical notation. Petri nets provide a modeling tool that is suitable for a wide variety of systems, from chemical reactions to business management logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that Petri nets were developed by practitioners, not mathematicians. The system was born from necessity, designed to fill a utility gap in other approaches to modeling. But because Carl Petri gave the system an exact mathematical definition for its execution semantics, we are able to represent Petri nets in terms of schemas and work with them in AlgebraicJulia.\n",

    "\n",
    "The whole concept of a schema originally comes from database theory. We can think of the underlying connections in a schema as linked data. For example the grey circles may represent a database of 'people' and a given arrow may repesent a tabulated relationship between those people (Who loves whom? Who is the enemy of whom? etc.) Building a schema is then just \"structuring a query\" on that database by defining new relationships in terms of existing ones.\n",

    "Data often gets corrupted when transferred between contexts, a major issue in database management. Data corruption is a kind of analog for our dangling edge condition on graphs. And in the same way that AlgebraicJulia will allow us to use high level abstractions to resolve our dangling edge problems, there are other category theoretic techniques for data migration that offer a canonical way of migrating data that automatically takes care of various annoying edge conditions.
