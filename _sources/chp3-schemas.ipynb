Chunky arrows are like variables for maps.\n",

Ordinary graphs connect 0-dimensional vertices using 1-dimensional lines. With simplicial sets we can also attach 2-dimensional triangles, building up triangulated surfaces. Going up another dimension we can attach 3-dimensional tetrahedra to make solid figures. And so on.\n",

Petri nets provide a modeling tool that is suitable for a wide variety of systems, from chemical reactions to business management logistics.\n",

    "The whole concept of a schema originally comes from database theory. We can think of the underlying connections in a schema as linked data. For example the grey circles may represent a database of 'people' and a given arrow may repesent a tabulated relationship between those people (Who loves whom? Who is the enemy of whom? etc.) Building a schema is then just \"structuring a query\" on that database by defining new relationships in terms of existing ones.\n",

    "Data often gets corrupted when transferred between contexts, a major issue in database management. Data corruption is a kind of analog for our `DANGLING EDGE CONDITION` on graphs. And in the same way that AlgebraicJulia will allow us to use high level abstractions to resolve our dangling edge problems, there are other category theoretic techniques for data migration that offer a canonical way of migrating data that automatically takes care of various annoying edge conditions. See the paper Functorial Data Migration[^2] for details.\n",
