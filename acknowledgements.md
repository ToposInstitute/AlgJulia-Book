**Behind the scenes**

This book is an experimental project, one of its kind in trying to use the modern features of technology to convey category theory concepts to a general science audience. The authors had to make a lot of design decisions to honor the limits of technology, to have the book open source, and above all to keep the content light, fun, and useful! 

Here are a few pictures we clicked during our group writing retreats!
